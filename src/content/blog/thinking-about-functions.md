## What is a function?

A function is a relation between a set of allowed inputs and outputs. And the function itself defines this relationship.

Let's supose a input set that contains `1, 2, 3, 4`, and the output set that contains `A, B`.

We have a clear relationship between `1, 2` to `A`, and `3, 4` to `B`. And the relation is defined by:

We say that a function is ***pure*** when given the same input, it always returns the same output. Remember that input and output are sets, so return the same output here, means return the same set, not the same value. For this reason, is safe to say that the function of our example is pure, because for given any number bigger than 3, it will always return `B` (true, in this case).
