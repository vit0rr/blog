## Introduction

An interesting fact about math is that you can demonstrate things. A lot of people thinks that demonstrate is exemplify something, but it is not. It's common to see people saying that $1 + 1 = 2$, just like one apple plus one apple is two apples. But, this is not a demonstration. A demonstration is a logical proof that something is true, by a formal way. You cannot say that every 1 plus itself is equal to two. Boolean algebra is a good example of this. In Boolean algebra, $1 + 1 = 1$. So, you can't say that aways $1 + 1 = 2$.
## What is Coq?

Coq is a software that allows you to write proofs. It is a proof assistant based on the calculus of inductive constructions. It is a functional programming language based on lambda calculus. I won't talk about lambda calculus and the calculus of inductive constructions, but you can find more information about them on Wikipedia.

## What is a formal proof?

A formal proof is a process based on logical rules and axioms used to demonstrate some theorem. The goal is to show an absolute truth that some affirmation is faithful by following strict rules.

## The proof

A simple way to prove that natural numbers are infinite is by defining that given a natural number ($n: nat$), $n + 1$ will return natural numbers greater than $n$.

You need to make it because this theorem proves that natural numbers are infinite by showing that given **any** natural numbers, you can **always** find a natural number greater than it, by summing $1$ to it.

So, lets to define our theorem in Coq:

```rust
Theorem plus_1_natural : forall n : nat, 1 + n = S n /\ S n > n.
```

The `forall` keyword means the theorem is valid for all natural numbers. The $\land$ means the theorem is a conjunction, and the $S$ is the successor function. So, the theorem says that given a natural number $n$, $1 + n$ is equal to $S n$, and $S n$ is greater than $n$.

Lets to prove the theorem:

```rust
Proof.
  intros n.
  split.
  - reflexivity.
  - apply le_n_S. apply le_n.
Qed.
```

`intros n` introduces the universal quantifier `forall` and the arbitrary natural number $n$ as a variable. The `split.` splits the objective into two subgoals. One for each conjunct $\land$. The hyphen is to refer to the subgoal. The `reflexivity.` is to prove that something equals to itself. Like $1 + n = S n$, because $1 + n$ is equal to $S n$. You can reduce it, like: 
 - $1 + 1 = 2$.
 - $2 = 2$.

Coq have some macros that abstracts some proofs. We can see this reducing using `simpl.`:

Coq gives us some theorems related to natural numbers ordering, like `le_n_S` and `le_n`. These theorems can be used to reduce steps of our proof, replacing them with the applied theorem. In math, the `le` it is $\leq$, less than or equal. 

- `le_n` any natural number is less than or equal to itself. $n \leq n$ is a true statement for any natural number $n$.

- `le_n_S` says that if $n \leq m$, then $S n \leq S m$. So, if $n \leq n$, then $S n \leq S n$.


The `apply le_n_S.` definition is `le_n_S : forall n m : nat, n <= m -> S n <= S m`, and `le_n` that `le_n : forall n : nat, n <= n`. So, to read the `apply le_n_S. apply le_n.` is: "Given a natural number `n`, if `n <= n`, then `S n <= S n`". And this is true, because `n <= n` is true, and `S n <= S n` is true too. So, the theorem is proved. `Qed.` means that the proof is finished.

You can also see it on CoqIDE:

## Conclusion

You can also show the output of the proof and run the proof. So, lets do it.

You can use `Print` to show the definition of some theorem, and `Eval compute in` to run the proof. In the end, our proof will be:

```rust
Theorem plus_1_natural : forall n : nat, 1 + n = S n /\ S n > n.
Proof.
  intros n.
  split.
  - reflexivity.
  - apply le_n_S. apply le_n.
Qed.
Print plus_1_natural.
Eval compute in (plus_1_natural 1).
```

And the output will be:

```rust
plus_1_natural = fun n : nat => conj eq_refl (le_n_S n n (le_n n))
: forall n : nat, 1 + n = S n /\ S n > n
```

```rust
= plus_1_natural 1
: 1 + 1 = 2 /\ 2 > 1
```
