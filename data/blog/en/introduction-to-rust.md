### Basic Data types in Rust

We have five types in Rust.

- integers
- floating-point
- compound types
- booleans
- characters

Integers can be unsigned(`usize`) or signed(`isize`).

`Unsigned` -> is for values that can't be negative. Ensure positive values OR if you don't need negative integers. Like memory address

`Signed` -> is for values that can be negative. Like offsets to addresses.
Examples of integers:

8-bit -> i8 -> u8\
16-bit -> i16 -> u16\
32-bit -> i32 -> u32\
64-bit -> i64 -> u64\
128-bit -> i128 -> i128

We too have `f32` and `f64` for floating-poing numbers. `bool` for booleans, `char` for characters and we have two types for strings: `str` and `String`.

### What's the diference beetwen `String` and `str`

`str` is static strings. You cannot change. Exemple:

```rust
let hello = "Hello, world"
// Is the same than:
let hello: &'static str = "Hello, world"
```

`String` is a vector. With vector you can change and not static

```rust
pub struct String {
    vec: Vec<u8>
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s);

    s.clear(); // error!

    println!("the first word is: {}", word);
}
```
