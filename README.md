# vitorsalmeida

Welcome to [vitorsalmeida.com](https://vitorsalmeida.com)! This is my personal website, where I share my thoughts and experiences about software development and other topics like math.

## Contributing

The idea of this website is to be simple and fast. So, I'll probably not accept any pull request that adds a new big feature or a new dependency. But feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you have some suggestion or find a typo.

## Running locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vit0rr/portfolio.git
```

```bash
cd portfolio
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you want to create a new post, run: 

```bash
npm run write
```
